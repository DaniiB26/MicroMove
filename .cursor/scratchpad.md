## Background and Motivation
MicroMove is an iOS app that promotes "exercise snacking" - the concept of incorporating short, frequent movements into daily routines. The app aims to make fitness more accessible by breaking down exercise into manageable micro-workouts that can be done anywhere, anytime. This approach helps users build sustainable healthy habits without the pressure of long workout sessions.

   - iOS background execution limitations
   - Battery efficiency considerations
   - User privacy and data handling

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Offline-first architecture
   - SwiftData implementation
   - Data synchronization and conflict resolution

3. **User Experience**
   - Minimalist, distraction-free interface
   - Intuitive exercise guidance
   - Responsive and performant UI

4. **Notification System**
   - Smart timing algorithms
   - User preference management
   - Do Not Disturb integration

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
> Task 1 completed.
> - Created a new Xcode project using SwiftUI template.
> - Established a clear folder structure: Models, Views, ViewModels, Services, Utils, and Assets.xcassets.
> - Added initial SwiftData models: Exercise, ActivityLog, Progress, Achievement, UserPreferences, WorkoutSession, and supporting enums in ExerciseTypes.swift.
> - Ensured all models use Codable enums and default values for SwiftData compatibility.
> - Verified the app builds and runs, and the models compile without errors.
> - No blockers encountered during setup.

> Task 2 completed.
> - Implemented the Exercise model with all required fields and enums conforming to Codable.
> - Set up SwiftData persistence for Exercise.
> - Implemented CRUD operations in ExercisesViewModel (add, fetch, update, delete).
> - Verified by adding, updating, and deleting exercises in the app; all operations work as expected.
> - No blockers encountered.

> Task 3 completed.
> - Implemented ExerciseListView with filtering by type and sorting by duration (ascending/descending).
> - Added ExerciseDetailView and ExerciseRowView for clear navigation and display.
> - Used ExercisesViewModel to manage state, filtering, and sorting logic.
> - Verified that exercises can be filtered and sorted, and details are shown correctly.
> - Added accessibility improvements and documentation comments.
> - No blockers encountered.

> Fixed two issues:
> 1. ActivityLogViewModel.addActivityLog now saves the modelContext after inserting a log, ensuring persistence.
> 2. ActivityListView now calls viewModel.fetchActivityLogs() in .onAppear, so the list refreshes when the view appears (like AchievementListView).
> 
> This should make new activity logs appear immediately after being triggered, without needing to restart the app.

> Implemented complete timer functionality:
> 1. ExerciseDetailView now uses @State showTimer and navigationDestination to navigate to TimerView
> 2. TimerView shows countdown timer with MM:SS format, exercise info, and cancel button
> 3. When timer completes, it logs the exercise completion and navigates back automatically
> 4. Timer properly cleans up on view disappear to prevent memory leaks
> 5. Added proper initialization to convert exercise duration from minutes to seconds

> Task 4 completed.
> - Integrated ActivityMonitor into ContentView using @StateObject for ActivityLogViewModel and UserPreferencesViewModel.
> - ActivityMonitor is initialized onAppear, requests notification permission, and checks/schedules reminders.
> - Added a "Test Reminder" button in the toolbar menu to manually trigger ActivityMonitor's checkAndScheduleReminder for testing.
> - All ViewModels are now shared across the app for consistent state.
> - Manual test: Run the app, open the menu, and tap "Test Reminder". You should receive a local notification if outside quiet hours and the inactivity interval is met.
> - If you do not receive a notification, check iOS notification permissions and quiet hour settings in preferences.
> - No blockers encountered.

> Task 4 completed.
> - Implemented complete Activity Detection System with smart notification scheduling.
> - ActivityMonitor handles quiet hours (including midnight spanning), inactivity detection, and user preferences.
> - Notifications start from reminder time or immediately if past reminder time, then repeat every interval.
> - After exercise activity, notification cycle resets from that activity point.
> - Added AppDelegate for foreground notification display and proper permission handling.
> - All core requirements met: background monitoring, customizable rules, time-based triggers.
> - Ready to proceed to Task 5: Progress Tracking Implementation.

## Lessons
> - Setting up a clear folder structure early helps keep the project organized and maintainable.
> - SwiftData models require enums to conform to Codable and use raw value types for persistence.
> - Using MVVM architecture from the start makes it easier to scale and test the app.
> - Documenting each model and property improves clarity for future development.
> - Initializing models with sensible default values reduces boilerplate and errors.
> - Combining filtering and sorting logic in the ViewModel keeps the UI code clean and maintainable.
> - Accessibility and documentation are important for usability and future development.

## Background and Motivation
> The Activity Detection System is a core feature that enables MicroMove to gently nudge users to move when they've been inactive, making the app proactive and supportive. By leveraging ActivityLog and UserPreferences, the app can track user activity, respect their preferences (like quiet hours), and deliver smart, timely reminders. This helps users build sustainable movement habits without being intrusive.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **iOS Background Execution**
   - iOS restricts background tasks for battery and privacy reasons.
   - Need to use allowed APIs (e.g., background fetch, notifications) and work within system limits.
2. **User Privacy and Control**
   - All activity tracking must be transparent and user-controlled.
   - UserPreferences must allow opt-in/out, quiet hours, and custom reminder intervals.
3. **Data Logging and Analysis**
   - ActivityLog must accurately record relevant events (app opens, reminders, exercise completions, etc.).
   - Data must be aggregated for streaks, reminders, and analytics.
4. **Notification Scheduling**
   - Reminders should only fire when appropriate (not during quiet hours, not too frequently).
   - Must handle edge cases (e.g., user disables notifications, changes preferences).

  - ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goal: Learn about user settings, state persistence, and UI binding.
  - ðŸ“˜ Educator Notes: How to use @Published and SwiftData for settings, and a sample UI for preferences.

- [X] Task 4.3: Background Activity Monitoring and Trigger Logic
  - âœ… Success Criteria: App detects inactivity (using ActivityLog) and schedules reminders according to user preferences.
  - ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goal: Explore background processing, notification scheduling, and logic for inactivity detection.
  - ðŸ“˜ Educator Notes: iOS background task patterns, UserNotifications, and a code snippet for scheduling a local notification.

- [X] Task 4.4: Notification Delivery and User Feedback
  - âœ… Success Criteria: Reminders are delivered only when appropriate, and user actions are logged in ActivityLog.
  - ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goal: Understand notification delivery, user interaction logging, and feedback loops.
  - ðŸ“˜ Educator Notes: Handling notification permissions, logging user responses, and a micro-exercise to simulate a reminder event.
