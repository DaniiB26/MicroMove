## Background and Motivation
MicroMove is an iOS app that promotes "exercise snacking" - the concept of incorporating short, frequent movements into daily routines. The app aims to make fitness more accessible by breaking down exercise into manageable micro-workouts that can be done anywhere, anytime. This approach helps users build sustainable healthy habits without the pressure of long workout sessions.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Background Activity Management**
   - iOS background execution limitations
   - Battery efficiency considerations
   - User privacy and data handling

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Offline-first architecture
   - SwiftData implementation
   - Data synchronization and conflict resolution

3. **User Experience**
   - Minimalist, distraction-free interface
   - Intuitive exercise guidance
   - Responsive and performant UI

4. **Notification System**
   - Smart timing algorithms
   - User preference management
   - Do Not Disturb integration

### 🛠️ Executor's Feedback & Assistance Requests
> **Task 1:**
> - Project created, folder structure set, models added, app builds. No blockers.
>
> **Task 2:**
> - Exercise model, persistence, CRUD all work. No blockers.
>
> **Task 3:**
> - ExerciseListView with filtering/sorting, detail views, accessibility, docs. No blockers.
>
> **Fixes:**
> - ActivityLogViewModel now saves after insert; ActivityListView refreshes onAppear. Logs update in real time.
>
> - Timer: ExerciseDetailView launches TimerView, logs completion, cleans up, and converts duration. Works as expected.
>
> **Task 4:**
> - ActivityMonitor integrated, requests notification permission, schedules reminders, "Test Reminder" button added. ViewModels shared. Manual test: notifications work if outside quiet hours and interval met. No blockers.
> - Complete Activity Detection: Handles quiet hours (including midnight), inactivity, user prefs. Notifications repeat, reset after activity. AppDelegate for foreground banners. All requirements met.
>
> **Task 5:**
> - ProgressViewModel refactored to use WorkoutSession only. Daily/weekly/monthly stats, streaks, active days. ProgressView shows stats, streaks, calendar, and session details. Manual/automated tests pass. No blockers. Ready for Task 6.
>
> **Task 6:**
> - Achievement system implemented: definitions, progress tracking, and notifications. Achievements are unlocked based on streaks, total exercises, and total minutes. ProgressViewModel observes workout data and updates achievements. Banner notification appears when an achievement is unlocked. Manual and automated tests confirm correct unlocking and UI feedback. No blockers. Ready for UI polish.

### 💡 Lessons Learned
- Early folder structure = maintainable codebase
- SwiftData enums: Codable, raw values for persistence
- MVVM from start = scalable, testable
- Documenting models/properties aids future dev
- Sensible model defaults reduce errors
- Filtering/sorting in ViewModel keeps UI clean
- Accessibility & docs matter
- **Activity Detection:** Plan for background/quiet hours, model events clearly for analytics
- **Progress Tracking:**
  - Aggregating from WorkoutSession (one per day) simplifies logic, future-proofs
  - Calendar/date math is key for streaks/stats
  - Removing old Progress model reduced complexity
  - UI feedback (animations, cards) boosts engagement
  - Simulated data/testing catches edge cases
  - Documenting logic helps onboarding
- **Achievement System:**
  - Used observer pattern to react to progress changes and unlock achievements in real time
  - Banner feedback for unlocked achievements increases user motivation
  - Grouping/sorting achievements in UI improves clarity
  - Manual and automated tests caught edge cases (e.g., unlocking multiple achievements at once)
  - Documenting achievement logic helps future expansion
