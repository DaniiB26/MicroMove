## Background and Motivation
MicroMove is an iOS app that promotes "exercise snacking" - the concept of incorporating short, frequent movements into daily routines. The app aims to make fitness more accessible by breaking down exercise into manageable micro-workouts that can be done anywhere, anytime. This approach helps users build sustainable healthy habits without the pressure of long workout sessions.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Background Activity Management**
   - iOS background execution limitations
   - Battery efficiency considerations
   - User privacy and data handling

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Offline-first architecture
   - SwiftData implementation
   - Data synchronization and conflict resolution

3. **User Experience**
   - Minimalist, distraction-free interface
   - Intuitive exercise guidance
   - Responsive and performant UI

4. **Notification System**
   - Smart timing algorithms
   - User preference management
   - Do Not Disturb integration
